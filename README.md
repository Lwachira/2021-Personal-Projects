# 2021-Personal-Projects

## What is this?

**The work here is a representation of the personal projects I did in 2021. You can look through my history from [2016](https://github.com/Lwachira/2016-Internship), [2018](https://github.com/Lwachira/2018-Work-History), [2019](https://github.com/Lwachira/2019-Work-History), [2020](https://github.com/Lwachira/2020-Work-History). If you wish to pursue this further, we should chat, I can explain all the interesting things I built over the last 3 years**.
